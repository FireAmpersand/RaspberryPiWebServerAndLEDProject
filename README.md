# RaspberryPiWebServerAndLEDProject
Project for building web server and running a leds off the web host  

Libraries used in this project: Flask, Neopixel, and rpi_ws281x.

How it works?
-The server.py file is running a flask web page that is being shown to the users. Every time a user clicks the selected pattern, it kicks -back to here for the server side to determine what to run. It then starts a Thread to run the leds so that the leds and web server can -run at the same time. The leds and thier patterns are in the python/leds.py file. The leds are run off of the neopixel.py file that is 
-generated by the rpi_ws281x library.

TODO:
-More animations
-Clean up files
-Commenting files
-Css styling for web page
-Better mobile useage
